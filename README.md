**Instructions:**

1. The python notebook file **'FinalYearCODE.ipynb'** and the datasets '**data**', '**testing**' must be under the same directory 'Digital_systems_project_20048494' such that


  **Digital_systems_project_20048494/FinalYearCODE.ipynb**


  **Digital_systems_project_20048494/data** --> that holds **HC_chunks** and **PD_chunks**. 
  (Digital_systems_project_20048494/data/HC_chunks) and (Digital_systems_project_20048494/data/PD_chunks)


 ** Digital_systems_project_20048494/testing** --> that holds HC and PD.
  (Digital_systems_project_20048494/testing/HC) and (Digital_systems_project_20048494/testing/PD)




**Important things to Note:**
1. Ignore the HC file (Digital_systems_project_20048494/testing/HC) and focus on PD file (Digital_systems_project_20048494/testing/PD) since all the data has been shited from HC to PD file for testing.
2. Files greater than 50 MB cannot be uploaded here, therefore refer the OneDrive link and download from there.
